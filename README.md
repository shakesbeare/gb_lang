# About Gb

Gb is a project I created to learn more about the inner workings of programming
languages. While it is not fully functional, it has achieved this goal and (usually)
works within its extremely constrained scope. 

# Why not use a parser generator?

Since Gb was primarily a learning exercise, I wanted to try and do as much as possible
of it from scratch. Armed with only my programming languages textbook and some serious
willpower, I created Gb by myself as an extracurricular project. There are a few
branches where I have experimented with using parser generators (like Pest), but
ultimately, these efforts weren't as fun for me as it was to build it from the ground
up.

# The future of Gb

I occasionally resume work on Gb. My plan is to one day make it a sleek scripting
language with powerful support interop with Rust. As of now, development of the project
has taken the back seat to my studies in college.
